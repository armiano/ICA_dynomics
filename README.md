# ICA_dynomics
Repository for the paper "High-Resolution Temporal Proâ€€ling of E. coli Transcriptional Response"


This repository contains all the scripts and processed data for the analyses presented in the paper. This includes the original experimental data post-processing (background subtraction and normalization), transformation into log2 data tables for ICA processing, and analyses of the ICA results using scripts from external repositories.

## Contents

- `Dynomics_data_log2-multiplePoints_final.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that takes the original CSV files as input and transforms them into the log2 data tables ready for ICA processing.
- `precise-db/`: This folder contains the scripts to run ICA found in the external precise-db repository.
- `pymodulon/`: This folder contains scripts for analyzing the results from the ICA run, utilizing scripts from the external pymodulon repository.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Input: Original CSV files of experimental data (post background subtraction and smoothing). 
   - Script: `Dynomics_data_log2-multiplePoints_final.ipynb`
   - Output: Log2 data tables
2. **ICA Processing**
   - Input: Log2 data tables
   - Scripts: Code in the `precise-db/` folder
   - Output: ICA results
3. **ICA Results Analysis**
   - Input: ICA results
   - Scripts: Code in the `pymodulon/` folder
   - Output: Analysis results

## Dependencies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Additional Python packages: pandas, numpy (Make sure to install these before running the scripts)
