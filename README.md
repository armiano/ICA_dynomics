# ICA_dynomics
Repository for the paper "High-Resolution Temporal Proâ€€ling of E. coli Transcriptional Response"


This repository contains all the scripts and processed data for the analyses presented in the paper. This includes the original experimental data post-processing (background subtraction and normalization), transformation into log2 data tables for ICA processing, and analyses of the ICA results using scripts from external repositories.

## Contents

- `Dynomics_data_log2-multiplePoints_final.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that takes the original data CSV files (post background subtraction and smoothing) as input and transforms them into the log2 data tables ready for ICA processing.
- `precise-db/`: This folder contains the scripts to run ICA cloned and modified from the original source code from the `precise-db/` repository.
- `pymodulon/`: This folder contains scripts for analyzing and visualizing the results of the ICA run. The scripts are modified from the original ones present int the `pymodulon/` repository.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Input: Original CSV files of experimental data (post background subtraction and smoothing). Rows represent the signal from each different cell type containing a certaing promoter driving GFP. Columns are time points. 
   - Script: `Dynomics_data_log2-multiplePoints_final.ipynb`
   - Output: Log2 data tables
2. **ICA Processing**
   - Input: Log2 data tables
   - Scripts: Code in the `precise-db/` folder
   - Output: ICA results
3. **ICA Results Analysis**
   - Input: ICA results
   - Scripts: Code in the `pymodulon/` as well as python script `iModulon_identification.ipynb`
   - Output: Analysis results
  
## Demo

Input for `Dynomics_data_log2-multiplePoints_final.ipynb`: Demo_data_heavy_metal.csv
